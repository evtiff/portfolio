425 Midterm 2:
  This project was focused on utilizing an nonparametric data set and comprehensive skills from the semester to display an understanding of the techniques
  used with nonparametric data analysis. 

  The dataset included economic mobility in 741 cities with 42 other variables. Within the project, exploratory data analysis was used to limit the variable 
  list to important contributors for economic mobility within each city to help create a model predicting economic mobility of cities.
