Spotify Tableau Dashboard:

This report was the final project in a class on Tableau Data Visualization. We utilized data pulled from the Top Hits list from the 70s 80s 90s 2000s and 2010s to
create an interactive storyboard allowing users to delve into data on these decades top hits. The goal was to find connections between hits of the decades and see
what predictions and inferences could be drawn from the data.
